What if I told you I could change your life in six weeks?

I'm talking big change -- your husband notices, your boss notices, even your kids notice. And so do you. You're more awesome at home, the office, with friends, everywhere in your life...

You in? Then keep reading, because I'm going to share a method I've used with thousands of clients, and in my own life, for designing the best version of you. Whether you're a parent, a CEO, a parent who is a CEO, or anybody in between, just follow my guidelines below, and I promise you that in six weeks, we will have rocked your world.

THE SECRET TO A BETTER YOU

Nobody's perfect. We all have crap that gets in our way -- aspects of our personality that quite frankly, suck. Let's call them "negative traits."

Negative traits come in all sorts of flavors -- impatient, mean, cold, steamroller, judgmental, intolerant, lazy, fake-nice, angry, sloppy, grumpy, late. Fact is, no matter how awesome you may be, everybody comes with some negative traits.

And if you're saying, "yes, but I already know mine, big whoop!" -- great. But what most people don't realize is how profoundly that stuff is sabotaging their happiness. Sure, you may know that you're impatient or judgmental or bossy, but most of us have no idea just how much a negative trait can run the show, get in your way, and kill your dream.

So how do we get that bad trait out of the driver's seat? The first step is to recognize that you've given it the wheel.
