Rock Your World guides youth through a thoughtful process of researching an issue of interest and then taking action to address it. Designed with multiple entry points and fully aligned with Common Core standards, the program features a comprehensive curriculum and the resources to help students, using various media to promote their designated cause. While  Rock Your World can be used in its entirety, lessons and units have been designed for teachers  to use as stand-alones, according to their students' needs, making it more accessible to you and the time you have available throughout the year.
